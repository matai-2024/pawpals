## About this project

This project was thought up by [Anahera](https://github.com/anaherawashere), and created alongside [Jack](https://github.com/jack-gloyer), [Dean](https://github.com/dean-tunbridge), [Sam](https://github.com/sam-pedersen), and [Amy](https://github.com/achoo-o).

Agile roles, pair programming, Github Projects, testing, and ticket review were utilised during its creation as part of [Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/)'s course. Browser extension [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) was also used to ensure accessibility needs were met.

The main libraries include react, vite, express, typescript, and knex. Tests are included to verify the code's behaviour and document expected features.
